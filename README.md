# Infosys-Spring-Board-Stroke-Patient-Healthcare-Milestone-4

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring in patients based on various medical features using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset includes features such as age, average glucose level, hypertension, heart disease, and other factors that are believed to influence the occurrence of stroke. The project demonstrates how to preprocess the data, apply a Logistic Regression model, evaluate its performance, and provide recommendations based on the results.

# Key Steps in the Project

# 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

# 2.Logistic Regression Model:

Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Optimize the model using techniques such as class balancing.

# 3. Model Evaluation:

Analyze precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy to assess model performance.
Evaluate the confusion matrix to understand the classification performance.
Investigate where the model performs well and where it lacks.

# 4. Bias in Dataset:

Discuss the class imbalance and how it affects model performance.
Suggest techniques such as oversampling (SMOTE) or undersampling to handle imbalance.

# 5. Mathematical Concepts:

Explanation of the Logistic Regression model, including the sigmoid function, cost function, and gradient descent.
Visual representations of formulas, such as the sigmoid curve and confusion matrix.

# 6. Observations and Recommendations:

Analyze the results and provide insights into which features are most significant in predicting strokes.
Offer recommendations to improve the model's performance by addressing class imbalance and exploring other models.

# Usage

# 1. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python Script:

You can run the project by opening the Jupyter Notebook file (stroke_prediction.ipynb) or running the Python script (stroke_prediction.py).

# 2. Data Loading:

The dataset is loaded using pandas from the provided CSV file healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv.

# 3. Train the Logistic Regression Model:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training set.
Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the confusion matrix are displayed.

# 4. Evaluate and Visualize:

The results of model evaluation (including confusion matrix and classification report) are displayed.
The confusion matrix is visualized using matplotlib for better interpretation.

# Output

The project provides:

A confusion matrix visualizing model performance.
Precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy values for the model.
Feature importance analysis based on logistic regression coefficients.
Observations and recommendations for improving model performance, such as handling class imbalance and trying more complex models.
